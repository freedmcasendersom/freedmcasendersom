Most installment payday loans have payments that exceed what typical borrowers can afford. Unaffordable payments can lead to the same types of problems that exist in the conventional lump-sum loan market: frequent re-borrowing, overdrafts, and the need for a cash infusion to retire debt.

Payday installment loan payments are usually much more than the 5 percent of income that borrowers can afford. And because lenders have access to borrowers’ checking accounts, either electronically or with postdated checks, they can collect the installments regardless of the borrowers’ ability to afford the payments. Similarly, in the auto title loan market, lenders’ ability to repossess borrowers’ vehicles can pressure customers to make loan payments they cannot afford, which in turn can leave consumers without enough money to meet their basic needs.

Table 2 shows how payday installment loan payments in several states consume between 7 percent and 12 percent of the average borrower’s gross monthly income (of just under $2,600) and compares that with loan payments in Colorado, where strong regulations require both smaller payments and lower prices.
