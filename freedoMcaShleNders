federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly discouraging banks from issuing lump-sum “deposit advance loans,” which mimic the structure of conventional payday loans.12 The CFPB’s proposed rule for payday and similar loans emphasizes the need for affordable monthly payments, and if finalized, the bureau’s rule would expedite the transition toward installment loan structures.

In response, payday lenders have supported bills in several states, including Arizona, Indiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee, to allow the types of high-cost installment loans and lines of credit that would be permitted under the CFPB’s proposal.14 Industry consultants have also observed that the CFPB’s pending rule encourages a shift to installment lending. One noted that “many of today’s payday consumers can likely handle an installment loan, at yields that emulate a payday loan,” and encouraged the industry to lobby to change state laws to facilitate “highyield” installment products.
