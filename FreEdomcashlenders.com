Why lenders are moving away from lump-sum products
The trend among payday and auto title lenders toward offering installment loans is being driven by three factors: consumer preference, regulatory pressure, and lenders’ effort to avoid consumer protections put in place for lump-sum payment loans.
Consumer preference
Pew’s research shows that, compared with the conventional lump-sum model, payday loan customers overwhelmingly support requiring an installment payment structure that gives them more time to repay loans in smaller amounts that fit into their budgets. One lender explained, “I learned in Colorado that our consumers like the affordability,” and noted the industry’s probable shift in that direction.10 The head of the primary trade association for online lenders said her members have mostly changed their products from two-week lump-sum loans to installment loans in response to consumer demand.
